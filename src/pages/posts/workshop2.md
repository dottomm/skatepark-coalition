## More Pizza
Bjorn Griepenburg, bought pizzas AGAIN and hosted another community workshop again with Grindline's Matt Fluegga to further the discussion and inform the public of the steps they have taken toward a new Petaluma Skate park since the last meeting in January. 

Thank you to Matt again for coming all this way to personally be a part of the discussion . 


##  A Location was Chosen
The Parks and Recreation Department surveyed the workshop attendees using a mobile polling app, <a href='www.Mentimeter.com'>Mentimeter.com</a> to select a favorite location from the list of available sites. A super majority voted for the Lucchesi Park location (54000 sq ft). A small portion of the younger kids voted for Kenilworth Park (24000 sq ft) due to it's proximity to town. Lucchesi also offers more than twice the square footage, complete with lights, better drainage, more availability of bathrooms.


## Next Steps
The Parks and Recreation department will bring these recommendations to the to the Recreation, Music, and Parks Commission.  Wednesday, March 15, 6 PM at City Hall. 11 English Street, Petaluma, CA. All interested parties are recommended to attend.
