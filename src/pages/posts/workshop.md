## It was a great community turn out.
Bjorn Griepenburg, Project Manager at The City of Petaluma bought pizzas and hosted a community workshop along with Matt Fluegga, Chief Executive Officer of [Grindline Skateparks](https://grindline.com/) to share with the Petaluma skateboard community a plan to finally build an improved skatepark.

There were lots of great discussions. Thank you to Matt and his team for coming to Petaluma and answering our questions.



## Survey Results
Prior to the community workshop a survey was circulated among the skateboard communtiy by Grindline Skateparks in an effort to gauge a list of park requirements and requests. The City of Petaluma will review the Grindline Skateparks survey results and approve a design that best covers all skaters wishes.  

Luma Skatepark Coalition will make the survey results available here as soon as we receive them so that  we can all provide feedback based on the same information. 


## Location

The park(s) will be built on city owned land, and the list of locations that the City Of Petaluma have agreed to consider for a new skatepark are:
        
        - Leghorn Park
        - Luccessi Park
        - Wiesman Park
        - Kenelworth Site

Grindline Skateparks will be  working with The City Of Petaluma to determine which of these are the best location. 


## Funding

The city has granted the Petaluma Skate project <span class='funds'>$469,000</span> from funds raised by Measure M.

Grindline Skateparks was paid <span class='funds'>$90,000</span> to consult, evaluate and design our next skatepark. 
After City of Petaluma approves a design the project will go out to bid. 


        $469,000
        -$90,000
        __________
        $379,000

<span class='funds'>Remaining Skatepark Funds: $379,000</span>

## Scope

The message in the room was the community wants to keep the existing skatepark, sans any investment, and build a new skatepark with the remaining funds at a new site that can accommodate a skatepark project that will be built in phases and to  continue with Grindline Skateparks to design phase one immediately. Additional money for more skatepark is to be raised through community outreach and fund raising.
