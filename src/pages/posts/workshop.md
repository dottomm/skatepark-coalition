# It was a great community turn out as expected. 
Lots of great commentary and questions. 


The attendees were glad to have a company as reputable as Grindline help design a skatepark Petaluma can be proud of. I think the consesus was community wants to keep the exisiting skatepark and develop a new skate feature with the current funds ($469,000), on a new piece of land that can accomodate a larger skatepark and look to philanthropy and fund raising to keep the project growing. 



## Bjorn and Chris shared their contact information, so feel free to reach out to them with any questions or ideas.
