It was a great community turn out as expected. Lot's of great commentary and questions. 

There was a lot of conversation about fund raising. But there was also a lot of support for the idea of taking the $400,000 and begin building something now. 

Bjorn and Chris were amical and the crowd was engaged. 
They've shared their contact information, so feel free to reach out to them with any questions or concerns.
